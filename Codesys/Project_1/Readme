# FB_GetCycleTime

## Description
`FB_GetCycleTime` is a function block designed to **measure and fix the cycle time** of a process in milliseconds.  
It calculates the elapsed time between the execution signal and its completion.

## Inputs
- **i_xExecute (BOOL)** : Execution signal to start the cycle time measurement.

## Outputs
- **q_xDone (BOOL)** : Indicates if the cycle time measurement is complete.
- **q_lrCycleTime (LREAL)** : Measured cycle time in milliseconds.

## Internal Variables
- **uiState (UINT)** : Controls the state machine.
- **timPreviousTime (TIME)** : Stores the start time of the measurement.
- **timCycleTime (TIME)** : Stores the elapsed time.

## How It Works
1. When `i_xExecute` is set to `TRUE`, the function block records the current time (`timPreviousTime`).
2. It calculates the elapsed time (`timCycleTime`) from the start time.
3. The elapsed time is converted to milliseconds and stored in `q_lrCycleTime`.
4. When `i_xExecute` is set to `FALSE`, the function block resets.

## Example Usage
```plc
VAR
    fbCycleTime : FB_GetCycleTime;
    cycleTime   : LREAL;
END_VAR

// Start cycle time measurement
fbCycleTime(i_xExecute := TRUE);
cycleTime := fbCycleTime.q_lrCycleTime;

// Stop cycle time measurement
fbCycleTime(i_xExecute := FALSE);
