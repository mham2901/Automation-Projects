This exercice is an essay to discover OpenPLC, it's about a basic ladder logic with 4 inputs C1, C2, C3 and C4 with 3 outputs Q1, Q2 and Q3
If only one switcher is pushed, only Q1 is activated, if we have 2 switchers pushed only C2 is activated. Q3 is activated only when all the switchers are pressed simultaneously. In each case, the other relays are off.
