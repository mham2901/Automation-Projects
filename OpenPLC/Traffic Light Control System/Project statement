A single-lane road junction with two opposing directions (North-South and South-North) is to be equipped with an automated traffic light system, as well as safe management of crosswalks. You need to design and program this system according to the following specifications:

System specifications :
Traffic light configuration:

Each direction (North-South and South-North) has three traffic lights:
One red light.
One yellow light.
One green light.
Pedestrian button:

A dedicated button allows pedestrians to request to cross the road safely.
Operating sequences :

The normal traffic light sequence for one direction is as follows:
Green light for 15 seconds.
Yellow light for 3 seconds.
Red light for the duration of the green and yellow lights in the opposite direction.
When a pedestrian presses the button, the current sequence should end normally, then :
All lights in both directions turn red for 10 seconds to allow pedestrians to cross.
Once the crosswalk is complete, the normal light cycle resumes.
Initial state :

When the system starts up, the North-South direction begins with a green light, and the opposite direction (South-North) begins with a red light.
Safety rules :

No direction should have a green light simultaneously with the opposite direction.
The transition from green to red must pass through the yellow light.
Technical data :
Inputs:

One pedestrian button.
Digital input: I0.0 (1 if button is pressed, 0 otherwise).
Outputs:

Lights for North-South direction:
Green light: Q0.0.
Yellow light: Q0.1.
Red light: Q0.2.
Lights for South-North direction:
Green light: Q0.3.
Yellow light: Q0.4.
Red light: Q0.5.

An arduino demo will is demonstrated
